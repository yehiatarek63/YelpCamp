### YelpCamp
 A Campground reviewing website that allows users to create a campground and add information about it including images, prices, location and description and other users can review it. This web app implements CRUD operations (creating, editing and deleting a campground). It also implements authorization and authentication since only an author can edit or delete his campground and the user must be logged in in order to create a campground or post a review. A hashing function is used to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
 Technologies used:
 - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript
 - node and express
 - MongoDB and mongoose
 - Cloudinary (to store all images posted in the website on a cloud service)
